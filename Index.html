As she goes about her way, she suddenly hears a strange voice in her head. It claims to be a guardian angel from Heaven, and she is skeptical at first, thinking that it's a demon. However, the unknown person makes himself visible and introduces himself, stating that his name is Forcas. He claims to want to guide the nun throughout this funeral, stating that she must keep to herself and not help anyone. The player can choose whether or not to follow this rule, and that will alter the nun's fate based on what she does.</p>
      </span> the game has MULTIPLE endings!</h2>
       <h3>ENDING 1:</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If the player ignores an unknown person locked inside a cage next to them, and tells the truth about one of the followers not having bought a Chrysanthemum, then the church will reveal to Angelica, the nun, that it was all a fake funeral to test if the pastor's wife was fully in control of the nun's body. This is because a possession ritual was performed on her during the wife's funeral to allow the deceased wife to come back to life through Angelica's vessel. However, according to Forcas, Angelica is still somehow conscious in her body alongside the wife, fighting for control. The church is now convinced that they don't have to do another ritual, and Forcas will from then on continue to try and salvage Angelica completely until she can defeat her possession.]

          </li>
      <h3>ENDING 2:</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If the player helps the unknown person locked inside the cage next to them, and lies about everyone having their Chrysanthemums, despite Forcas' warnings about doing so, then the church will turn on her and think that the possession ritual on her did not work last time, because the pastor's wife "would never fall for cheap tricks like this" (helping the follower without a flower and letting out the person in the cage). The church prepares her for another possession ritual.]</li>
